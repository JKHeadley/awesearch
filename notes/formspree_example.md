If you're looking for a free all-in-one solution for contact pages with form customization, anti-spam features, and automatic response emails, Mailchimp is a great option, offering a free plan with most of the essential features you need, including basic form building and email automation capabilities. 
Key points about using Mailchimp for contact pages:
Form customization:
You can design your contact forms with various fields, including name, email, message, and more, and customize the look to match your website. 
Anti-spam features:
Mailchimp includes built-in spam filters and CAPTCHA options to help prevent bot submissions. 
Autoresponder emails:
Set up automated email responses to send confirmation messages or follow-up emails to users who submit your contact form. 
Other potential options to consider (depending on your specific needs):
WordPress with a contact form plugin:
WPForms: A popular plugin with a drag-and-drop interface, offering extensive customization options and integration with Akismet for anti-spam protection.
Contact Form 7: Another widely used WordPress plugin with a good balance of features and ease of use. 
Important factors to consider when choosing a solution:
Free plan limitations:
Check the free plan's limitations on contact form submissions, email list size, and features available. 
Integration with your website:
Ensure the contact form solution can easily integrate with your website platform (like WordPress). 
Advanced features:
If you need more complex features like conditional logic or detailed analytics, consider a paid plan.
