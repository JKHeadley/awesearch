Localizely Hreflang Checker
Localizely Hreflang Checker
Score: 4.5

While primarily focused on hreflang verification, the Localizely tool could provide some insights into meta tag configurations. However, it's not geared towards generating Open Graph meta tags or previews for social media links.

Carousel Hero
Carousel Hero
Score: 4

Carousel Hero is mainly focused on creating engaging carousel posts for platforms like Instagram, so it‚Äôs not the best fit for generating Open Graph tags. It‚Äôs useful for visual content but does not serve the specific needs of your request.

I've done a lot of research and haven't found a definitive answer to this. Is there anyway to test the open graph on localhost? I don't haven any issues using the graph api on locahost. I've changed my website url in the app settings and have even tried setting up a domain in my hosts file but the debugger linter for open graph tries to use the actual domain instead of my localhost and when using locahost directly the linter completely fails connecting. Does anybody have any workarounds for this?

Using a local proxy is the right solution. ngrok didn't work for me neither. A similar tool that did work with facebook debugger is localtunnel ‚úÖ npm install -g localtunnel lt --port 8000 # or using npx without installing localtunnel npx lt --port 8000 Generates a url that looks something like https://<random_hash>.localtunnel.me/. Using this url in facebook open graph debugger worked for me as of October 18th 2017. I only had to hit Fetch new scrape information button. üçª Cool thing about localtunnel is that you can easily host your own localtunnel server with github.com/localtunnel/server so if it ever stops working with localtunnel.me, you can run your own somewhere in the cloud ‚õÖ

What's the easiest way to get Open Graph meta tags on an e-commerce website?
Answer ¬∑ 0 votes
It depends on which e-commerce program. Some will have an add-on that you can install and simply add the meta tags via your admin with a few clicks. If an add-on doesn't yet exist for your ecomm program, the simplest way is to switch to a different program, or have a programmer add them for you.
