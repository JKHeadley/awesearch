          developers and entrepreneurs discover the perfect tools and resources
          for their projects. Our platform combines expert-curated sources,

        <Text color={textColor}>Here's how AweSearch works:</Text>
        <VStack spacing={4} align="stretch" pl={4}>
          <Text color={textColor}>
            1. <strong>Curated Data Collection:</strong> We reference trusted
            developer sources, such as{' '}
            <Link
              href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome"

              Awesome lists <ExternalLinkIcon mx="2px" />
            </Link>
            , to extract and maintain a comprehensive database of development
            tools and resources.
          </Text>
          <Text color={textColor}>
            2. <strong>Semantic Search:</strong> When you enter a query, our
            advanced vector database employs semantic search to identify tools
            and resources that are conceptually relevant to your needs, going
            beyond simple keyword matching.
          </Text>
          <Text color={textColor}>
            3. <strong>AI-Powered Analysis:</strong> Our sophisticated Large
            Language Model (LLM) then analyzes the initial results, scoring each
            tool based on how well it fulfills your specific query. This step
            ensures that the most appropriate solutions rise to the top.
          </Text>
          <Text color={textColor}>
            4. <strong>Personalized Insights:</strong> Finally, the LLM provides
            a tailored assessment for each result, explaining how it addresses
            your unique requirements and why it might be the right fit for your
            project.
